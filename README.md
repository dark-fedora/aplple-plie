#  Aplple Pie
## Purpose
This is a userscript made by a Tacos fan intended to remove the need to ever hold the Apple in your inventory.

The Apple is a snack that lets you see many "hidden" statistics.
I use the word "hidden" in quotes, as all of these are easily accessible through endpoints.
Loading up endpoints can be disruptive, however, and using other sites might not be everyone's preference.

This script is for this reason only designed for the people who:
1. Do not like the process of buying a slot, buying the Apple, looking at the page, selling the Apple, and selling the slot.
2. Would prefer not to, or for some reason are unable to, use supplementary websites or the endpoints to view statistics at the present only viewable with the Apple, or through those means.
## Likely outcomes
As holding the apple for a brief time is guaranteed to cost you 3 votes if you do not already use a utility, proxy (i.e. another player holds the apple and sends updates), or the endpoints to bypass this, this is likely to increase the power and control that independent Fans may have over the election.
## How it works
This is a fairly simple userscript, with 2 functions as of the initial commit.

First, this userscript will automatically load the data from any endpoints into an accessible location in the console. This should make the data more legible and easy to understand.

Second, this userscript will load the hidden stats of any player that you pull up, regardless of if they are on your team or not.
## Intent
Knowing that many things are possible with the endpoints, there are a few uses of them that I will bring up to specifically reject.
Even as someone who enjoys engagement in deep FK, these are things which would detract from Blaseball as an activity for many people.
I cannot stop you from doing these things; however, I will give a warning.

Blaseball has not had a historically "positive" reaction towards exploitation of its API or endpoints.
This was the reason for the Second Strike, and for the introduction of Shelling.

### Espionage
With the addition of the Apple being able to view Will vote distribution, I made a discovery this week that shows it is now possible to view the Will Vote distribution, and Stadium Renovation progress of any team in the league, provided you have the correct UUID (which is simple to obtain).

While similar endpoint discoveries have been made before (such as being able to view the FK stats of *any* player, not only the ones on your team), the only harm those exploits brought was the improved ability to target players for Plunder/Exchange.

However, the ability to view any team's election-related statistics/progress is a sharp vulnerability that is not to be encouraged.
More "competitive" players may disagree with this, and fork this repository to enable such capability, and there is truly nothing I can do about this except ask those who find this to not engage in such activity.

This seems like a very plausible way to take the fun out of the game for not only yourself, but also for *other teams*, who will have had no say in your usage of such tactics.

I'd like to amend an official statement about Blaseball frequently cited: "There's no wrong way to play Blaseball [*except by hurting the enjoyment of others*]."

This is a frequent rule among fan communities, and if your community does not have it, then I suppose I'm being a bit hypocritical.
However, I think it's fair to ask that you do not use the capabilities of this script, or reverse-engineer it, to do something that would make this game less enjoyable for other Fans.

We are all love Blaseball.
